                Fight! Space Exodus is 2D multiplayer shooting game played in space. Players shoot to destroy each others ship and once they
                destroy the ship, it leads to power up of the ship. I made a custom packet class to transmit the data between server and game with both UDP and TCP.
                TCP packet for player's connection and disconnection because these information never have to be dropped. But for the players' data such as positions, rotations, bullets etc
                are being sent by UDP for the performance. The server is made with .NET and the game is made with Unity(C#), .NET.
